		\frametitle{Welcome}
		This talk is intended to give a beginner-friendly introduction to machine learning using Python and the Keras/TensorFlow library. Neural networks have been successful in many different types of problems recently, from image recognition to board game strategy. Although the theory behind machine learning is complex, the Keras library makes it very easy to set up a simple neural network. We will be working in Python, but no experience is necessary to follow along. We look forward to seeing you, and we invite you to bring a friend from outside the department!
